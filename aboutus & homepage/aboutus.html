      <p >The struggle is inextricably tied to the end. It takes willingness and strength to keep moving forward until your mission and vision is achieved. which at once seemed impossible. This journey of Team Genesis 16 Motorsports was full of ups and downs, but what allowed us to continue despite these difficulties are the words of motivation of our visionary.

        <h4>Success</h4>
        <p>
          Success is “The accomplishment of aim or purpose”. Success could depend on several factors such as team coordination, time management, decision making and logical thinking ability, and so on. Success provides happiness and peace of mind when all the team members put in their 100% towards a shared goal and complete it. Everyone has different opinion about success, whether it is completing a small task of finishing a book or manufacturing and assembling a part.
